# Mobile Frontend
Please use **Yarn** instead of **Npm** as Npm might cause problems in combination with Expo. 

## How to run?
Execute following commands in separate terminals: 
1. **yarn start**
2. **yarn start android** // or // **yarn start ios**

## UI-Frameworks
We use "React-Native-Base" as it is the most popular and maturest UI-framework for React-Native (it's native, by the way!). 
Moreover, we use "React-Native-Elements" additionally, as it is famous too and covers other UI-components (maybe replace 
this library in future).
