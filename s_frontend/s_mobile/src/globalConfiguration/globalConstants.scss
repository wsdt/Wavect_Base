/** IMPORTANT: Encapsulate all styles into components itself. As components are modular too, we do not need to
* make styles there modular too! This would only have the drawback that we might get styling bugs when changing it
* for a components.
*
* Therefore, only place really universal variables here but not one single class or id!
* E.g. Colors might be a good choice, everything else should be discussed!
*
* Please be aware that no or an empty typescript-declaration file might be generated for this stylesheet as it should not contain
* any classes or other explicit definitions (only variables). */
