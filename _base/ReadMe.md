# Base configurations / template(s)

This folder contains parent configurations or template files which might be used by the majority of all services. 
E.g. they might extend from those. 

## But why?
Good question! Imagine having a configuration in several backend services or/and frontend services and having the necessity to change it. Without extending from a unified base configuration, you would need to change the configuration in all child projects!
