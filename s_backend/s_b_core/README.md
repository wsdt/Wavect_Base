# Backend core service
Node.JS with typescript support by the use of the express framework. 
Before executing 'npm start' you should execute **npm install** if you have never run this application before. 

## npm start
Run **npm start** to start the server. I used **nodemon** which restarts the server automatically when you make changes to your code (for convenience). Additionally, by the execution of npm start all typescripts get compiled to javascript to ensure that you see the all your changes.
